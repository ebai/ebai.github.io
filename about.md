# about me

---

_**I am a music producer, songwriter, software developer and music technologist living in New York City.**_

---

I grew up in Massachusetts, studying performance at Berklee College of Music and singing in the MMEA All-State Chorus. I attended the [Music Technology](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/programs/music-technology) program at NYU, where I studied audio engineering, electronic product design, DSP/MIR development and computer science.

I spent several years releasing electronic music under the alias [soupandreas](http://soupandreas.com/), which accrued millions of plays and let me perform my music around the country. Today, I'm writing and performing as [Good Morning Club](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1pvckjRfnPNJkH7YlrKgv2?si=Mih9JqJ2TKuscM1bpDcSKQ).
