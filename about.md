# about me

_**Ethan Bailey** is a 21 year music producer, composer, software developer and music technologist living in New York City._

I grew up in Massachusetts, studying performance at Berklee College of Music and singing in the MMEA All-State Chorus. I am a recent graduate of the [Music Technology](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/programs/music-technology) program at NYU, where I studied audio engineering, electronic product design, DSP/MIR development and computer science.

I spent several years releasing electronic music under the alias [soupandreas](http://soupandreas.com/), which accrued millions of plays and let me perform my music around the country.

I also built up a strong passion for programming and design in school. I founded Odea[link] with three like-minded friends and we set out to build instruments that encourage new ways of making music. While studying studying sound spatialization and synthesis at [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/), I began working on what would eventually become Odea's first product, the Chorale.
